# Topstep Web Developer Take Home

## Purpose 
  Create a simple, static, responsive, and highly accessible website. 

## Instructions

  Refactor the header and form elements to match the design and to be responsive and accessible. 
  The form submission handling should be done using javascript.

## Requirements

- There are two designs attached within the img folder. 
One shows the [ideal design for mobile/tablet](./img/Mobile-design.png), the other shows the [ideal design for desktop](./img/Desktop-design.png).
Try to match the design but don't worry about having exact margins/paddings.
- On smaller screen sizes (such as phones and tablets), we want
to make the header 75px and use the smaller logo. 
- On smaller screen sizes (such as phones and tablets), we also want to hide the links and quote in the header. 
- This should be responsive and accessible.
- Clicking 'Submit' should reveal an alert that contains the name and email that the user typed into the form.
- No libraries: Please don't add any external libraries. 

## Bonus Points
 - Host this static site somewhere - if you do host this, please post the url here.
 - Disable the submit button unless all fields are valid.
 - Anything else you want!
